Solubility Analysis of Chemical Compounds using Linear Regression Models in the Analysis of Solubility of Chemical Compounds. Linear regression models were applied for better data analysis, using a dataset of solubility of chemical compounds to demonstrate the main foundations of the different regression and neural network models. Therefore, to achieve the required purposes in this project, the Ordinary Regression model, Penalized (Ridge, specifically), Partial Least Squares (PLS) were used, in addition to the use of Principal Component Regression to obtain a more accurate result and reduce prediction errors. In addition, a Neural Network model for regression was constructed to test the model's test data set.
